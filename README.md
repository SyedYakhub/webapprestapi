Project: Role-Based Diary Management System

Description: Developed a secure, role-based diary management system using Spring Boot and MySQL. The application leverages Spring Security to implement robust authentication and role-based authorization, ensuring users can only perform actions they are authorized to do.

Key Contributions & Technologies Used:

- Spring Security Integration: Integrated Spring Security to handle authentication and role-based authorization, ensuring secure access to application resources.
- Role-Based Access Control: Implemented role-based access control for different user roles, allowing specific operations based on user roles.
- RESTful API Testing: Extensively tested all REST APIs using Postman, ensuring correct functionality and robust error handling.
- MySQL Database Design: Designed and implemented a MySQL database schema to store user and diary entry data.
- Spring Boot Application Development: Utilized Spring Boot to develop the application, leveraging its ease of use and rapid development capabilities.
- Data Access with Spring Data JPA: Used Spring Data JPA to simplify data access, making it easier to perform CRUD operations on the MySQL database.
